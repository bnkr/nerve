The unit tests are organised thusly:

Each directory has its own CMakeLists.txt which causes the tests to be 
compiled and adds them to the ctest runner.

- test/src/
  Any header or library files specific to running tests but are not actually
  tests themselves.
- test/scripts/
  Helper scripts for meta-generating tests.  The test framework causes these
  to run; they are run with the working directory as the one they are in.
- test/data/
  Data loaded by tests.
- test/examples/
  Tests of documentation examples.
- test/$component...
  Root directory for a particular component's tests.
- test/$component.../mod/
  Synthetic tests of each module, where a module is a class or a function.  
  Modules with multiple/complicated tests might have their own subdirectory.
- test/$component.../case/
  Tests of a specific case which involves many classes or in some way doesn't 
  fit with a particular module.  Subdirectories categorise the test cases.
