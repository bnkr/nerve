NAME
----

nerve - command-line client for the minimalist daemon music player

SYNOPSIS
--------

*nerve* 'comand' [ 'args' ... ]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The *nerve* command-line interface communicates with the *nerved(1)* daemon to
alter its state for example doing such revolutionary things as playing files.
Nerve doesn't have a media libary so all operations are on the file system.

OPTIONS
-------

General
~~~~~~~

These options are common everywhere.

*-h*, *--help*::
  Print some help.  If a command is set then the help might be about the
  command.

*-f*, *--force*::
  Bypass some validation, e.g. adding files which don't exist (yet).

*-v*, *--verbose*::
  Say more stuff.

Playlist
~~~~~~~~

+add+ 'file'...::
  Takes one or more files to append to the playlist.

+remove+ < 'file' | @'num' > ... ::
  Remove files from the playlist or positions with @-synax.

+replace+ [ *-p* | *--play* ] < 'file' | @file > ...::
  Clear the existing playlist and replace with another one.  The currently
  playing song will end normally and continue to the new playlist unless *-p* is
  given in which case it happens immediately.

+clear+ [ *-s* | *--stop* ]::
  Clear the playlist.  The current song keeps playing until the next track
  change unless *-s* is given.

+loop+ [ 'on' | 'off' ]::
  Toggle or explicitly set playlist looping.

+list+::
  Print everything in the playlist.

Playing
~~~~~~~

+stop+::
  Stop playing and reset file position to zero.

+start+::
  Begin playing.  Same as seeking to zero when something is already playing.

+pause+::
  Stop playing but keep the position where it is.

+seek+ [+|-] < h:m:s | num% >::
  Seek to position in the file.  When the plus or minus is given then it is an
  offset.

+next+ [ *-w* | --wrap | *-n* | --no-wrap ]::
  Skip this song and go to the next one.  *-w* or *-n* specify wrapping round
  the playlist of not wrapping respectively.  If wrapping is off and there is
  nothing to wrap to then the action is the same as stop.

+previous+ [ *-w* | --wrap | *-n* | --no-wrap ]::
  As +next+ but in the opposite direction.

Output
~~~~~~

+volume+ [+|-] 'number'::
  Set the volume to a value out of 100.  Setting to zero is not equivilent to
  muting because the previous volume won't be restored on unmute.  When the plus
  or minus sign is given then the number is an offset to the current value.

+mute+ [ 'on' | 'off' ]::
  Toggle or explicitly set mute.

Status
~~~~~~

The command:

  nerve +status+ [ format ]

Will report the daemon's state.

Format is as follows:

*%f*::
  Path to file playing.

*%s*, *%S*, *%t*, *%T*::
  Position in the track.  %S and %s are seconds, while %t and $T are human
  readable times.

*%p*, *%P*::
  Position of current song in playlist and the total number of songs in the
  playlist.

*%l*, *%L*::
  Whether loop is enabled.  *%l* is an integer while *%L* is the text 'enabled'
  or 'disabled'.

*%%*, *%n*::
  *%%* escapes a percentage sign and *%n* is a newline.

*%v*::
  Current volume.

The default format is +%p/%P \'%f' %t/%T %v+ or something similar (i.e don't rely
on it in scripts).
