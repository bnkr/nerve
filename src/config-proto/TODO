Stage Validation
----------------

* types of stages
* check types are ordered properly, and the always-required ones are there.
* check in semantic or uasage?  Semantic is neater, of course.
* modify pretty-printer with the various details

Configuring Plugins
-------------------

* arbitrary configuration data -- we need to configure each plugin, so there
  must be some kind of configure sdl { field = value } thing.  This data also
  needs to be accessable to the rest of the program.

Test Framework
--------------

- pretty printer must print job/section/sequence/stage in yaml or something
  similar
- option --dump-config
- ruby lib to compare two outputs

Integrate
---------

Requires working config-proto, and finished connectors in the pipeline bit.

* modify the pretty-printer to declare each pipeline object
* add the real initialisation stuff to the pipeline objects (constructors,
  storage etc...)
* use the gapless stuff to create working stages
* use the socket proto to make the most simple possible command reciever
  - we can deal with true communication and updating some other time.
* we should have output!
