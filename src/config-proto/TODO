Semantic Pass
-------------

* store locations in relevant places (mostly just for the "after" field)
* more validation of semantic bits (notes in the semantic pass function).  A lot
  of this would be done by writing the pretty printer.

Pretty Printer
--------------

* finish make_pipeline pretty-printer
* make some code to support unit tests:
  - use the pretty printer
  - api like `nerved --config x --dump-config`
  - I guess ruby will suffice for this

Usability Features
------------------

* multiple files (means we might need to store locations in more places, e.g
  duplicated section name and be careful about lexer init etc.)
* arbitrary configuration data -- we need to configure each plugin, so there
  must be some kind of configure sdl { field = value } thing.  This data also
  needs to be accessable to the rest of the program.

Integrate
---------

* requires teh plugin-proto code to be completely working
* we'll need to use the gapless stuff to create working stages
* modify the pretty printer to create the entire pipeline
* we'll do this in a new protoype; to be honest it's probably ready to go in
  nerved (this will be in config/, and plugin-proto in pipeline/; the stages
  themselves will be elsewhere)
