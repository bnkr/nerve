Integrate
---------

Requires working config-proto, and finished connectors in the pipeline bit.

* add the real initialisation stuff to the pipeline objects (constructors,
  storage etc...)
* use the gapless stuff to create working stages
* use the socket proto to make the most simple possible command reciever
  - we can deal with true communication and updating some other time.
* we should have output!
