This source is organised a little differently than the standard:

- include/  - private include files for all parts.  This is -I..
- libnerve/ - the nerve client library; headers for this are in ../include.
              This normally must be built before the plugins.
- input/    - input specific plugins.
- output/   - output specific plugins.
- plug/     - normal plugins.
- nerved/   - the nerve daemon.
- nerve/    - the nerve cli client.
- research/ - various experimental programs in their own directories.

I build all packages from the main CMakeLists.txt except where noted.
