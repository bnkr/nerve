A full explanation of the multi-threaded pipeline design is available in doc.

In addition, the pipeline module contains the means to initialise the pipeline,
and the bridge between the config module and the pipeline module.  The bridge is
the configure() function.

Apart from some exceptions (at the time of writing only create_stage), only the
configure function interacts with both the pipeline and the config.  This
exception should be removed at some point.

Creation of pipeline objects is done by the create_x functions.  This abstracts
memory managment and storage.  Each create_x must ensure that pointers are not
invalidated by subsequent operations either on the returned object or on the
existing pipeline object.
