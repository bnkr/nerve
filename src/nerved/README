Architecture
------------

The daemon is quite modular.  The main() function is a good explanation of how
the modules are set up and the entry points for each one.

* util/ -- general or shared stuff
* cli/ -- command line parser and settings storage
* config/ -- configuration file parser and storage
* output/ -- logging and error reporting
* pipeline/ -- pipeline objects (stages, sequences, ...)
* server/ -- client-serve communication bits
* player/ -- running the pipeline, server, and player state; essentially a
  post-setup main().
* stages/ -- loading plugins and implementation of built-in stages.  Entry point
  is create.hpp which is queried by pipeline.  Bits of stages are also used by
* btrace/ -- debugging library
* para/ -- parallelism library
  config.
