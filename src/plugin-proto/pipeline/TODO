* communication with the progressive buffer.
  - I put a pipe junction in there which has different meanings in the spec and
    data pipe code.
  - the intended meaning by the spec is that the junction has connectors in it
  - since we know a sequence only returns zero or one packet then it's not a
    huge deal to just return a literal packet.
* name of packet_return
* header file for packet_return (packets.hpp or stages.hpp or its own?)
