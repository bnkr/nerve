* communication with the progressive buffer.
  - I put a pipe junction in there which has different meanings in the spec and
    data pipe code.
  - the intended meaning by the spec is that the junction has connectors in it
  - since we know a sequence only returns zero or one packet then it's not a
    huge deal to just return a literal packet.
* name of packet_return
* header file for packet_return (packets.hpp or stages.hpp or its own?)
* connectors in general:
  - output in section?
    * sequence returns a packet ptr (or perhaps even a packet_return)
    * we have to check whether the sequence is buffering
      - that has to be done anyway
    * no virtual output
    * we have to check whether the sequence returned anything
    * useless checks on returnedness/bufferingness for observers sequences
      - so basically, a couple of extra ifs per sequence.
  - output in sequence?
    * virtual call to the connector when we could just return (that's one per
      stage)
  - I think that we are pretty much resolved on them being in sequences, but it
    needs to be written down somewhere clearly (perhaps the docs for
    sequence_step ?)
