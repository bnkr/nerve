Implementation
--------------

Turn the existing protocode into a real implementation.

* see pipeline/TODO for making everything compilable/linkable
* tidy the spec and put it in doc
  - need to clarify some bits about why there are these multiple levels
  - also there needs to be some more clarification about the section blocking
    bits
  - should mention backtracking with multiple buffering stages

Integration
-----------

Integrate the code with the config reading parts.  See config-proto (which will
be the basis for it).
