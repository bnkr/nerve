This prototype has mostly failed.  There is still no reasonable way of doing
degapifying.

Summary:

* code to write an input stage (ffmpeg)
* code to write an output stage (sdl)
* various ideas about degapifying
* implementation of degap is not really workable as a pipeline stage (it'd need
  to be re-written, but then I'd have to do that anyway given the quality)
* lots of requirements on packets found out

The conclusion is that the best working method at the moment is:

* use amplitude thresholding
* work on a track-by-track basis (i.e don't care about the track before and
  after; just degap if there is silence at the track boundary).
* make it within a working pipeline implementation
* try different ideas out using generalised stages
