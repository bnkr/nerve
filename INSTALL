CMake Build Tutorial
====================

Introduction
------------

This file is a simple tutorial for building with CMake, and also an indicator of
the conventions used in my CMake projects.  It is aimed as a quick way to get
you familiar with CMake and provide some of the requisite knowledge to fix any
problems which might arise.  I mention Autotools as a comparison, but knowledge
of it is not expected.

This file is written in asciidoc markup.  You can find a generator to write
various flavours of output at http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/[].  There is
also a decent syntax highlighter for vim.

The file is hyperlinked: an anchor is defined with the ++\[[name]]++ syntax.  A
link is inserted with +\<<name>>+ syntax.  Therefore, you can use a simple
word search to find the link end.

Conventions
-----------

CMake operates on input sources and output binaries.  These are placed in the
source and binary directories.  In-source builds -- that is when the source and
binary directories are the same -- are discouraged.  In fact You will often find
that in-source builds will not work as expected and therefore, if the build
system detects that the source and binary directories are the same and the
developer has not explicitly allowed that case, then the configure will fail
immediately.

Instead of an explicit `./configure` command, CMake is configured using the
+cmake+ program itself.  The configuration is determined by the ``CMake Cache'',
which is simply a file containing some variable assignments.  You can find it in
the binary directory: +CMakeCache.txt+.  It should not be edited manually, but
it can be useful for debugging.  The project is configured by assigning values
to the flags.

Pre-Build
---------

In order to start the build, we must have a binary directory anywhere outside
the source directory or in a new subdirectory of the source directory.

You will need to know:

- which compile flags will you build with.
- whether you want debug symbols or not.
- install locations.
- what compile toolchain you are using if it is different from what can be
  found in your path.
- which features of the project you wish to enable.

Note that you do not need to be aware of any project-specific options for this
step.

Initialisation
--------------

CMake is a ``lazy'' build system.  It outputs files which are used by some other
program to actually build the program.  The generator is the program which will
be used, for example "Unix Makefiles".  The available generators vary depending
on the installed build of CMake.

Note that a separate binary directory is assumed by my builds.  In-source builds
might not work at all; in particular you should be aware that the build system
will delete certain directories on a `make clean` and it is not ensured that the
build system is the one that actually created them.

In your binary directory, run the following command:

  cmake -G "Your generator" $OPTIONS path/to/src

The +$OPTIONS+ should be replaced with CMake cache variable definitions which
shall be explained in <<Configuration>> and <<Configuring_Features>>.

You might also want to add the +-Wno-dev+ option to disable warnings which are
only applicable if you are going to modify the build system (though note that
sometimes those warnings can give clues in case of error).

IMPORTANT: You *must* set your compiler toolchain cache variables in this step
because CMake will ignore any changes you make later.  See the section
<<Changing_the_Toolchain>>.  If you do not set the toolchain then CMake will
detect one.  This is normally what you want unless you are cross-compiling.

You can also use the CMake GUI to perform this step; just fill in the boxes as
labelled.

Be aware that CMake doesn't always stop immediately if there are errors, so make
sure to scroll up to see any errors.

Configuration
-------------
[[Configuration]]

Unlike Autotools, there is no `./configure` script.  Instead either the `cmake`
with +-D+ options is used, `ccmake` curses GUI, or `CMakeSetup.exe` (deprecated
now) on win32, or the `cmake-gui` Qt executable.  Usage of the graphical
programs should be obvious, and descriptions of the variables are available in
the status bar.  Of course if you know exactly what variables you need to
define, then you can define them all in the initialisation step:

  cmake -G"Your generator" -DVAR=value path/to/src

Note that the `cmake` binary can simply be used as a non-interactive variable
setter in an already-initialised binary directory:

  cmake -DVAR=VAL path/to/binary_dir_or_source_dir

In the GUI programs, there is an ``advanced mode'' which is used for more
detailed customisation and/or fixing dependencies.  If all goes well, you
should not need to use this feature.

The only variable you *should* set is +CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE+.  This controls which
compile flags and configurations are built.  You almost certainly want
+Release+ or +RelWithDebInfo+ unless you are hacking on the project, in which
case choose +Debug+.  There is also +MinSizeRel+ for small binary size
optimisation.  These names are purely by convention.  Some authors use other
names or prefer to use the anonymous build type; I always expect the use of
these standard types.

Note that there is currently no way to build binaries with and without debug
flags at the same time since output names for both configurations are the same;
you need two binary directories.

Another important variable is +CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX+, which defaults to
+/usr/local+.

If you wish to customise compile flags --- for example to add a new directory
to the include path --- then set the variables +CMAKE_$thing_FLAGS_$config+
where '$thing' is one of:

- +C+ - flags for C compiles.
- +CXX+ - flags for C++ compiles.
- +EXE_LINKER+ - flags for linking executables.
- +SHARED_LINKER+ - flags for generating .so, .dll etc.
- +MODULE_LINKER+ - for building shared objects which will be loaded explicitly
  (plugins, in other words).

'$config' is the upper case version of the +CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE+ you selected, for
example use +CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELEASE+ for C++ flags when the +CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE+
is +Release+.

Be aware that in +Release+ build type, CMake defaults to defining +NDEBUG+ which
removes assertions.

The final caveat is that only one configuration can be built at a time.
Therefore, if you need +RelWithDebInfo+ libraries and Release libraries, then
you must generate two bindirs.  (This is actually not such a big deal - if there
are different FLAGS then the targets must be built twice anyway).

NOTE: When you have finished configuring with `ccmake`, remember to press ``c''
to commit those changes!

Configuring Features
--------------------
[[Configuring_Features]]

CMake configuration options take the place of the +--enable-x+ and +--with-x+
options of Autotools' `configure`.  The details of specific options should be
documented in the project's +README+ file, but every option created by the
project has built-in documentation which can be accessed with `cmake -LH[A] -N`
(see <<Fixing_Configuration_Problems>>).

Option naming conventions are a little confused at the moment.  The ``proper''
convention is to prefix options with the project name followed by an underscore;
for example for a project called ``foo'' then the options should be named
'FOO_x'.  Older parts of my CMake library use a prefix of 'WANT_' instead.

There are usually some configuration variables in the ``advanced'' mode.
Obviously these are not worth touching unless you really need advanced
customisation.

Documentation options usually have '*_INSTALL' and '*_REBUILD' variants, for
example +WANT_API_DOCBOOK_INSTALL+.  The presence of the +REBUILD+ option
indicates that there are pre-built docs.  This will always reside somewhere in
the +doc/+ tree.  For documentation targets without +REBUILD+ options, and
+INSTALL+ implies a rebuild.

Implementation of the install/rebuild options varies.  More recently developed
commands will set sensible satisfiable defaults at initial configuration, and
will fail at configure with a descriptive message if (for any reason) the
configuration cannot be satisfied.  Many older commands will either give an
error about +-NOTFOUND+ variables being used in a target or will fail at
`make` time because some files or programs cannot be found.  Since options are
always named like the `make` targets they are attached to, you should be able to
work out which output is failing and either disable it or fix the dependencies.

Some very old commands will always have targets generated regardless of whether
they are possible or not.  This means that the build or configure will fail
regardless of what the configuration options are.  In this case you must always
have the required dependencies available.  This annoying property should be
limited to docbook at this stage.

If all else fails, disable everything and selectively re-enable options,
re-building each time.

Configuring Dependencies
------------------------

During configuration, the build system will search for headers, programs,
libraries and compiler features.  This is all automated in CMake but can be
overridden by the user defining variables.  These are nearly always advanced
variables.

The build system will, in general, attempt to detect the best default
configuration for the available dependencies; for example if +asciidoc+ is
missing then any Asciidoc documentation will be turned off by default.  The
user's direction will never be overridden silently.

Some rare targets will use fall back dependencies when some requirement cannot
be found.  In such cases, there should be a status message.  For example, the
Latex output will use either +pdflatex+ or +latex+, depending on which can be
found.

For libraries and programs CMake will attempt to generate a target with the
missing dependency and will fail to configure.  For headers, there will be a
compile error.

I always use cache variables suffixed +EXE+ for programs, +LIB+ for libraries
and prefixed +HAVE+ for headers.  I do not often check for headers.  CMake
itself sometimes adds dependencies and will use its own conventions.  Typically
CMake's convention is to use +LIBRARY+ and +EXECUTABLE+ suffixes.  This varies
with older CMake modules.

Fixing Configuration Problems
-----------------------------
[[Fixing_Configuration_Problems]]

For a simple form of introspection, run the following commands:

  cmake -LH -N path/to/bindir
  cmake -LAH -N path/to/bindir

These will list the existing variables.  +-H+ means print the help text for each
variable, and +-A+ means also print advanced variables.  Note that some
variables are automatically set up by CMake so they only have a generic
description.  The +-N+ means perform no operation.  If it is not given then
`cmake` will return a failure code, though it still works.

If some things are missing, in the build (headers, binaries, libraries...) then
try this command:

  cmake -LAH path/to/bindir | grep -B 1 "\(LIB\\|EXE\\|HAVE\)" \
    | grep -B 1 "\(=$\|NOTFOUND\)"

The second grep restricts the output to only missing variables.  Note that the
first grep relies on my own conventions.

In the case of +HAVE_x+ values, it will either require an addition to the
'*FLAGS' variables to add an include directory, or to patch the source file
which looks for the missing header.

If you would like to see what is going on internally, `grep` the build scripts for
+option(+ for the boolean options and +CACHE+ for the string-like variables, or
latterly +bconfig_option+ and +declare_options+.

CMake simply initialises a cache when you first run it; the variables are set
and then are never changed unless the user says so.  Therefore, if you upgrade a
library after making the cache, the old library will still be used.  The same is
true of some methods of dependency checking, so if some files have moved around
the cache may be invalid (sorry, this is just how the glob function works in
CMake).  CMake provides a +rebuild_cache+ target to check everything again, or
of course the brute force way is simply to delete the binary directory and start
again.

If you are totally lost and prepared to look inside the build system code, then
open the main +CMakeLists.txt+ and, after the initial +include()+ statements
but before the +bconfig_project+ (called +bsetup_init+ in older projects) call,
add the code:

  set(BUTIL_ARG_PARSE_DEBUG_OUTPUT FALSE)
  bconfig_debug(TRUE)

This will produce a very large amount of trace output which might be useful in
detecting problems with the build.  Output generally looks like ``function():
target: message''.  Debugging can be turned off for a particular function (or
sometimes set of functions) in the way shown above --- +bconfig_debug+ won't
touch variables you have already set.  I have set debugging for the function
function +butil_arg_parse+ off because it produces huge amounts of output which
are likely to be totally useless to you.

Building
--------

As mentioned before, use the generator you selected to build the project.  The
makefile generator provides the standard targets:

  make all
  make install

Note that sometimes +install+ targets do not recognise build dependencies
correctly so it is usually necessary to run `make all` before `make install`,
however `make all` will always make enough targets to ensure a successful
install except in the case of my old-style doxygen generation library where it
is possible to configure it to install and not rebuild while there are no
pre-build docs.  In this case, a nice big warning message is printed in the
configuration step.  I will remove this library in future builds.

Also note that there can be other targets added, and information about these
is typically printed during the initial configure step, especially when the
build type is +Debug+.

If there are special instructions, then they will be in the +README+.

Installing
----------

There are two methods of installation: CPack and the generator.  The generator
uses the standard way of installing, for example `make install`.  CPack is more
advanced and can produce binary packages (also via the generator).  The packages
are built using the generator target +package+ and are activated based on the
variables +CPACK_<BINARY|SOURCE>_<type>+.

Using `make package_source` for a source tarball is also available, but this is
a poor substitute for Autotools' make distcheck and is not recommended unless
you heavily script it; for example, it will simply tar the entire source
directory, which necessitates that you somehow create a clean source tree to
make the package.

See here for more:

  http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake:CPackPackageGenerators

Note that while generating .deb is supported by the build system (including
automatically finding dependencies), the package is usually not suitable for
general distribution.

Also, note that while there is good +DESTDIR+ support from the makefile, this is
for debugging and the program is expected to use the +INSTALL_PREFIX+ CMake var.

You might also want to look into using the program `checkinstall`, which will
turn an install script like `make install` into a deb or rpm.

I only write trivial installs of built material.  If there is some special
post-install step, then there will be details in the +README+.

CMake does not supply an uninstall target, however for my builds the following
command will suffice:

  xargs rm install_manifest.txt

+install_manifest.txt+ is produced by the `make install` target and is part of
CMake.

Changing the Toolchain
----------------------
[[Changing_the_Toolchain]]

The preferred method of changing the toolchain is to use CMake's cross-compiling
features.  All my projects which run on multiple platforms are designed to be
cross-compiled and CMake makes this pretty easy.  You must define a toolchain
file which explicitly sets the compiler and linker variables.  This is
documented on the CMake wiki, here:

  http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake_Cross_Compiling

You must *initialise* the CMake cache with:

  cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=whatever path/to/srcdir/

CMake's implementation prevents the compiler from being changed retroactively at
this time.

NOTE: The toolchain file is just a collection of set() commands which overwrite
the various variables.  Therefore you may also define locations of libraries and
programs in this file, though it is not explicitly documented that this is OK.
Some library parts of CMake which do not anticipate this pattern might overwrite
some variables, however it seems to be very rare.  The toolchain file can be
used as a persistent set of defaults for all your CMake builds in this way, but
be aware that CMake can include the file multiple times.

The following are relevant variables to set:

- +CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME+ - must be what CMake would have selected on the target
  system.
- +CMAKE_C_COMPILER+, +CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER+
- +CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH+ - list of paths to search in.  This path acts as a prefix
  to the standard paths to it *must* have the standard layout of +bin/+,
  +include/+, +lib/+, etc. if anything is to be found.
- +CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_<thing>+ where '<thing>' is one of +PROGRAM+,
  +LIBRARY+, or +INCLUDE+.  Set to +ONLY+, +NEVER+, or +BOTH+ to search for
  '<thing>' using the +CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH+ list, the host environment, or both
  respectively.

Here is an example of a linux-to-windows cross-compile toolchain (sans any
validation):

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
message(STATUS "Settings cross-compile toolchain for Windows.")

# the name of the target operating system
set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME Windows)

# which compilers to use for C and C++
set(CMAKE_C_COMPILER   i586-mingw32msvc-gcc)
set(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER i586-mingw32msvc-g++)

set(CROSS_PATH     "/home/bunker/src/cross/win")
set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH "/usr/i586-mingw32msvc" "${CROSS_PATH}")

# Search for programs in the host environment.
set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PROGRAM NEVER)
# Search headers and libraries in the target environment
set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_LIBRARY ONLY)

# Get all include paths in the dir. REMEMBER to get rid of these when cross
# compiling new libraries for the cross environment or these overrides will mess
# up their compile!

# This is for running unit tests with wine.
set(BTEST_WINE_DLLPATHS "${CROSS_LIB_PATH}" "${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}")

# The header files are stored in my cross-compile environment.  Remember the
# _directories commands only apply to targets created *after* directories is
# called!
include_directories(BEFORE "${CROSS_PATH}/include-override")

# See FindQt or ccmake output for other vars available here.  This method can
# apply to things other than Qt.
set(QT_INCLUDE_DIR "${CROSS_INC_PATH}/qt4.4.3/")

set(QT_QTGUI_INCLUDE_DIR "${QT_INCLUDE_DIR}/QtGui")
set(QT_QTGUI_LIBRARY "${CROSS_PATH}/lib/QtGui4.dll")
set(QT_QTGUI_LIBRARY_RELEASE "${CROSS_PATH}/lib/QtGui4.dll")
#set(QT_QTGUI_LIBRARY_DEBUG "?") #  <- not found on my unix system

set(QT_QTCORE_INCLUDE_DIR "${QT_INCLUDE_DIR}/QtCore")
set(QT_QTCORE_LIBRARY "${CROSS_PATH}/lib/QtCore4.dll")
set(QT_QTCORE_LIBRARY_RELEASE "${CROSS_PATH}/lib/QtCore4.dll")
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package Layout
--------------

Just in case things go really badly :)

- COPYING - license.
- README - quick introduction to the packge.
- README.* - description of some specific documentation; usually related to
  installation or configuration.  I prefer manpages for runtime things.
- INSTALL* - this file, and any other specific information.
- CMakeLists.txt - main build system file.  Usually all installable targets are
  built using this file.
- Doxyfile.default - a partially configured doxygen configuration.  The build
  system overrides and/or adds variables to this to get the correct output.
- examples/ - code used in documented examples.  Note that not all of these
  are directly buildable; they are intended to be used by doxygen.  If they
  are intended as independent examples, then they will have a comment with
  how to compile them at the top and will be installed separately as part of
  the documentation.
- share/ - architecture independent data which will be installed.
- doc/ - all documentation.
- doc/man - usually uncompressed roff text, but sometimes things to be
  processed to turn into roff text.
- doc/html, doc/latex - a copy of what is generated by doxygen.  Note, if there
  are multiple doxygen outputs, these appear in doc/<output-name>/
- src/ - for executables and libraries.  The main source file normally matches
  main.* for an executable, and lib*.cpp for a library.
- build-aux/ - things strictly used for building and testing.
- build-aux/description.txt - general description of the package.
- include/ - mirror of the main include directory which we will install.
- dist/ - bundled libraries.  Usually there are just some more include/ dirs in
  here.
- test/ - unit tests.  There's usually a README to explain these.

In the binary directory outputs are ususally named very similarly to their
target names.

Distributing
------------

My build system is weighted towards making it easy to compile rather than easy
to distribute, so here are some hints to help:

- the main license is always in COPYING, but some files have additional info.
- I pre-process man pages quite often.
- you do not need to clean the build system when building multiple
  configurations (except when changing the compiler) so you can save some time
  if you are making a split package.
- doxygen is built with virtually everything turned on (I am a glutton for
  pretty pictures) . You might want to make a different doxyfile.  HAVE_DOT is a
  good one to turn off.
- using `make package` will be hard work, sorry :)
