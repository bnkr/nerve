=== CMake Build Tutorial ===

This file is a simple tutorial for building with cmake, and also an indicator of
the conventions used in my cmake projects.  It is aimed as a quick way to get 
you familiar with cmake and provide some of the requisite knowledge to fix any
problems which might arise.  I mention autotools as a comparison, but knowledge
of it is not expected.

== Initialisation ==

Unlike autotools, CMake is principally designed for out-of-source builds.  In 
fact You will often find that in-source builds will not work as expected.  
Therefore: pick a directory anywhere outside the source directory and run the 
command:

  cmake -G "Your generator" path/to/src

CMake is a `lazy' build system.  It outputs files which are used by some other
program to actually build the program.  The generator is the program which will
be used, for example "Unix Makefiles".  The available generators vary depending
on the installed build of cmake.

Be aware that cmake doesn't stop immediately if there are errors, so make sure 
to scroll up to see any errors.

If you know exactly what configuration variables are necessary then you can 
define them in this command:

  cmake -DVAR=value path/to/src

Note that if you wish to change compilers or any part of the toolchain, then 
those changes must be in this step.  Subsequent toolchain changes will only work
if you wipe the binary directory first.

== Configuration ==

Again unlike autotools, there is no ./configure script.  Instead either the 
cmake with -D options is used, ccmake curses GUI, or CMakeSetup.exe on win32.
Usage should be obvious, and descriptions of the variables are available in
the status bar.

In my projects, I always use WANT_x variables for boolean variables which 
take the role of autotools' --enable-x and some of --with-x.  String variables
are usually prefixed by by their WANT.  For example, for WANT_DOCS, there 
may be a DOCS_GENERATOR string.

If you would like to see what is going on internally, grep for 'option' for 
the boolean WANTs and CACHE for the string-like variables.

Advanced mode is used for specifying the locations of things which are not 
detected by the build system, for example if you have a newer version of 
something stored in ~/.  Look for variables which are suffixed -NOTFOUND
which should not be.

The *FLAGS variables are important in this step.  You may want to specify
additional optimisation and/or debug options.  Which variable is used depends
on the BUILD_TYPE (which you also should edit).  Typically, the build type
`Release' is what is required.  Leaving the build type empty will sometimes
result in trace code used for developing being included.

Note: when you have finished configuring ccmake, remember to press `c' to
commit those changes!

== Building ==

As mentioned before, use the generator you selected to build the project.  The
makefile generator provides the standard targets:

  make all
  make install

Note that sometimes install targets do not recognise build dependencies 
correctly so it is usually necessary to run make all before make install.

Also note that there can be other targets added, and information about these
is typically printed during the initial configure step.

== Cross-Compiling ==

All my projects which run on multiple platforms are designed to be cross-
compiled and cmake makes this pretty easy.  You must define a toolchain file
which explicitly sets the compiler and linker data.  This is documented on the
cmake wiki, here:

  http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake_Cross_Compiling

You may also define locations of libraries and programs in this file, though it
is not explicitly mentioned that this is OK.  Some library parts of cmake which 
do not anticipate this might overwrite some variables, however this seems to be
very rare.

The toolchain file can be used as a persistent set of defaults for all your 
cmake builds in this way.

== Installing ==

There are two methods of installation: cpack and the generator.  The generator 
uses the standard way of installing, for example `make install'.  CPack is more 
advanced and can produce binary packages (also via the generator).  The packages
are built using the generator target `package'.  

Using `make package_source' for a source tarball is also available, but this is 
a poor substitute for autotool's make distcheck and is not recommended unless 
you heavily script it; for example, it will simply tar the entire source 
directory, which necessitates that you somehow create a `clean' source tree to 
make the package.

You will usually need to define some CMake variables to get CPack to generate 
the right packages.  They are of the form CMAKE_BINARY_x where x is one of TGZ,
TBZ, RPM, DEB, and some others.  See here for more:

  http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake:CPackPackageGenerators

You might also want to look into using the program `checkinstall', which will 
turn an install script like `make install' into a deb or rpm.
