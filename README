Nerve is a multi-threaded stream-based frequency processing engine daemon (ie, 
an MP3 player).  The emphasis is on output quality and it does not have a
GUI intrinsic to the application.  It's main features are software mixing and
removing gaps between tracks for seamless playback.  It uses ffmpeg and sdl,
and therefore is fast and supports a great number of platforms.
