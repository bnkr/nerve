Nerve is a minimalistic multi-threaded audio stream processing engine daemon 
(ie, an MP3 player).  The emphasis is on output quality and it does not have 
a GUI intrinsic to the application.  It's main features are software mixing, 
gapless playback for all files (including non-lame encoded mp3s), and a simple
interface to run external programs.  It uses ffmpeg and SDL, and is therefore
fast and supports a great number of platforms.
