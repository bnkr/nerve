Intro
-----

Nerve is yet another entry into the massive list of audio players, and an entry
into the much smaller list of daemon-based players.  The idea of nerve is to
focus on audio output quality and *only* audio output.  The player simply 
maintains a play list and your settings for output processing.  In fact, even 
this is optional to an extent.

The primary aim in output quality is to go to any lengths to get gap-less output
from *all* files -- not just if they support some special field or the phase of
the moon is right but for every file.

The secondary aims are as follows:

- Fast :).  Most importantly low or no overhead for plug-ins and using your
  hardware instead of software if possible.
- Use mature input/output libraries.
- Simple and general method of IPC.
- No cruft; deal only with files and keep the code short and sweet.
- Use Amarok as an optional front-end.
- Don't mess with the hardware volume!
- Multi-threaded plug-in pipeline.

Installation
------------

See the INSTALL file.  It is not the standard generic tutorial.

The short form is:

  mkdir _build
  cd _build
  # Make sure you set your toolchain in this step.
  cmake -G"Unix Makefiles"  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
    path/to/source/
  # Choose configure options and set lib locations.
  cmake -DVAR=VALUE
  # Configure missing dependencies (if any).
  cmake -Dx_LIB=lib
  # And/or use the curses GUI.
  ccmake .
  make all test
  su
  make install

Getting Started
---------------

- read the man page for nerved(1) daemon.
- look in the configuration files.  They are well commented.
- configure your plug-ins.  It helps to know a little about your hardware and
  audio collection for this.  For example, if all your hardware is good it will 
  support many sample rates and you will not need a sample rate conversion 
  plug-in.
- start the nerve daemon.
- pick a client and use it!

Similar Work

I have no enemies, only rivals :)

* mpd - http://www.musicpd.org/
  Good gapless support, but only for lame encoded mp3s.  Comparatively slow.  
  More mature than nerve.  Very big code-base.  Has an entire media library 
  thing which basically wraps the file system.  Network transparent IPC.
* XMMS2 - http://wiki.xmms2.xmms.se/
  Same comments as mpd although xmms2 has many more clients than mpd and 
  is rather faster.
* mocp - http://moc.daper.net/
  Only one UI but still client/server.
* yauap - http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/yauap
  Reasonably fast and works as an Amarok back end.  Adds gaps ^^.
