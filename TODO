Main Todo
=========

Integration
-----------

This todo is just here to say "check the src directories".  I'll start using
this file when those are all done.

Status (as of 27th Feb 2011):

* config: integrated
* pipeline: connectors to do
* server: not integrated (see socket-proto)
* plugins: not prototyped
* outputs: integration started-ish; see gapless-proto and nerved/stages

New prototypes:

* degap-mk2-proto
  - use gapless-proto
* volume control plugin
  - special because it must respond to the socket stuff
  - also because it might be that the output plugin can do volume control more
    easily
  - both are tricky because it either involves some kind of special
    implementation, or we need to mess with arbitrary packet transfers (event
    mask or something).
