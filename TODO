Main Todo
=========

Prototypes
----------

This todo is just here to say "check the x-proto/ directories".  I'll start
using this file when those are all done.

Status (as of 14th Feb 2011):

* config-proto (finished and integrateed)
* gapless-proto (finished; supplies code for i/o and a bit for gaplessness)
* plugin-proto (make compilable enough to use in integration)
* socket-proto (no work done yet on any kind of protocol and communication with
  the pipeline is a bit hazy)

New prototypes:

* degap-mk2-proto
  - use gapless-proto
* volume control plugin
  - special because it must respond to the socket stuff
  - also because it might be that the output plugin can do volume control more
    easily
  - both are tricky because it either involves some kind of special
    implementation, or we need to mess with arbitrary packet transfers (event
    mask or something).
