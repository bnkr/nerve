Main Todo
=========

Integration
-----------

This todo is just here to say "check the src directories".  I'll start using
this file when those are all done.

Status (as of 12th Mar 2011):

* config: integrated
* stages: integrated
* pipeline: connector multi-threading
* server: alter pipeline, ipc protocol
* plugins: modularised (stages) but implemenation not planned

New prototypes:

* degap-mk2-proto
  - use gapless-proto
* volume control plugin
  - special because it must respond to the socket stuff
  - also because it might be that the output plugin can do volume control more
    easily
  - both are tricky because it either involves some kind of special
    implementation, or we need to mess with arbitrary packet transfers (event
    mask or something).
